## Code Examples
```java
// Example program in Java to calculate the factorial of a number
public class Factorial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 5;
        int factorial = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
            factorial *= i;
        }
        
        System.out.println("The factorial of " + number + " is: " + factorial);
    }
}

``` 
```c#
// Example program in C# to check if a number is prime
using System;

class PrimeNumber {
    static bool IsPrime(int number) {
        if (number < 2) {
            return false;
        }
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.Sqrt(number); i++) {
            if (number % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    static void Main() {
        int number = 17;
        
        if (IsPrime(number)) {
            Console.WriteLine(number + " is a prime number.");
        } else {
            Console.WriteLine(number + " is not a prime number.");
        }
    }
}
